For this reason, while I attended a <strong>traditional art-focused high school</strong>, I started to learn things like graphic design and 2d animation. <br>Later, I decided to enrol in the <strong>Multimedia Arts</strong> course at the Academy of Fine Arts of Carrara. There I learned the basics of many new media art fields, like UI/UX design, Web development, photography, sound engineering, stop-motion, video art, filmmaking, and interactive installations.</p><p>During my first three years at Carrara, I discovered my talent and passion for web development. In 2014, I obtained a First level Diploma (Bachelor's degree equivalent) in Multimedia Arts, with a thesis about web and procrastination. The commission didn&rsquo;t know if I was serious or if I was trying to trick them, so they gave me a grade of 110/110 cum Laude.</p><p>After that, I decided to attend the specialisation in <strong>Net Art and Digital Cultures</strong>, also at the Academy of Fine Arts of Carrara. In this course, I focused my curriculum on UX/UI Design and Web development (experiencing the use of VR in Three.js, in my main project), but I also dabbled in guerrilla marketing, game design, pixel art animation, and 3D printing. I managed to pass all the exams of my curriculum with excellent grades. However, for personal reasons (some of them more severe than the ones that brought me to write about procrastination in my previous thesis), the date of the dissertation is still to be defined.</p><p>In the last 9 years, I have also improved my development knowledge and skills day after day. I've been using new techniques in each project, reading books, software documentation, and blogs, as well as following various courses, content creators, conferences, and online workshops.</p>",

Even simply seeing or holding an old object found in an attic, a flea market, or a museum, and imagining its past, has always been thrilling for me. <br>I've also always loved crafting, inventing, and enhancing stuff, as well as solving riddles and puzzles. So, I soon found a way to join these two passions in games. I'm mainly into Role Play Games (tabletop or live-action) and video games. My interests have not been simply hobbies but <strong>a way to improve various soft skills.</strong></p><p>In my teen years, I used these hobbies to <strong>practice my digital skills</strong>: designing logos, posters and layout guides, and later creating my first web pages. I even took on responsibilities as a board member of a local board game association. <br>My main games are Cyberpunk 2020 and Vampire the Masquerade. For the latter, I took part in the organisation of many LARP games as a storyteller and collaborated with various gaming associations. In this way, I built a personal network with people from every part of Italy and abroad.</p><p>My relationship with video games has been essentially personal. I'm most fond of the sagas of The Legend of Zelda, Diablo, Baldur's Gate, and Starcraft. In the early years of the past decade, I also grew to love indie games, especially The Binding of Isaac, Undertale and Hades. I have always tried to investigate the functioning of the various aspects that make up a video game. However, only with the discovery of the indie games world, <strong>I ended up taking part in several game jams</strong>, mainly in the role of pixel artist and animator, UI designer, storyteller and game designer. <br>A couple of years ago, I also got to try the Souls series, falling in love with their silent narrative, discoverable in dialogues, environmental details and descriptions. They are currently my favourite gaming passion, while I'm waiting for the new Zelda chapter, of course 😉</p>",
