In addition to development, were also held during these days: meetings, training on content uploading, layout changes, revisions, and website release. <br>Aware of the limited time available, and to avoid mishaps and delays, I chose to rely on easy solutions in which I was highly confident, and that made it easy for the client to upload content. For this reason, I built a small WordPress theme that benefits from the CMS built-in AJAX features since it is necessary for a real-time content filter by custom fields.</p>",
